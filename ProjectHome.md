FreeSteel is a program originally written by Julian Todd and Martin Dunschen and released under the GPL.  It generated an adaptive clearing strategy tool path for screen display.

The libactp (Adaptive Clearing Tool Path Library) is an implementation of the GPL'ed algorithm demonstrated in FreeSteel as a set of C library functions.  This library can then be wrapped for use in other languages such as Python or Perl.

It has been evaluated in HeeksCNC
